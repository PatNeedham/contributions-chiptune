# contributions-chiptune
What does your contributions graph sound like? Find out with this script! It works iterating through the contributions graph one week at a time and assigning each day of the week a frequency based on its color value. The frequencies for the week are then overlayed and played by a Web Audio API oscillator, creating a neat chiptune.

##How to use
1. Open up the dev console with f12
2. Paste `makenoise.min.js` (or non-min, if you're brave) into the console
3. Lower your volume a lil' bit
3. Press enter if you haven't already
