# contributions-chiptune
What does your contributions graph sound like? Find out with this script! It works by assigning each day a frequency based on its color value, which is then played by a Web Audio API oscillator. The script loops through each column (week) of the graph and plays each day at once, creating a neat chiptune. 

##How to use
1. Open up the dev console with f12
2. Paste `makenoise.min.js` (or non-min, if you're brave) into the console
3. Lower your volume a lil' bit
3. Press enter if you haven't already
